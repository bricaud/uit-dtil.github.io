# Pitch-day for external master's proejcts in computer science and machine learning

We invite all Norwegian companies, the public sector, and other organizations to present your ideas for master’s projects for the computer science and machine learning students at UiT. 

This is a great opportunity to connect with students having an interest and background in computer science and machine learning. Presenting your company and AI projects may help find relevant students and future employees. By offering a master project and recruiting a student for 6 to 12 months you can strengthen your team, get a new perspective on your projects, transmit your values and possibly find a new employee.

The event is hosted by the [Digital Technology Innovation Lab](https://uit-dtil.github.io/) and [SFI Visual Intelligence]https://www.visual-intelligence.no/() at the Departments of [Computer Science](https://uit.no/enhet/ifi) and [Physics and Technology](https://uit.no/enhet/ift). The event will be on the **5th of April from 14:15-16:00**. The companies and organizations are invited to give a short online presentation, and the students can join online or at Teknologibygget: Auditorium, 1.022. 

If you are interested in hosting UiT master students for their final year project we ask you to fill out **THIS FORM**. including contact persons and a high-level description of the project. We will make this information available to all students. The **deadline for registration is 1st of April**. We will provide feedback and invite those suitable for a master’s project to give a pitch at the event.

For the presentation you should prepare a few slides describing your company, and some projects that are ongoing. Examples of master projects you had in the past would also be beneficial. The presentation should be maximum 5 minutes.

The students invited to the event are starting their 4th or 5th year in the fall. Most students do their master’s project in their 5th year, but it is also possible to work on the project over the 4th and 5th year. The master’s projects are either over two semesters (60 credits), or only a pre-project in the fall (10 or 20 credits) followed by the master’s project in the spring (30 credits). They are supervised by at least 2 persons, someone from the company, directly involved in the project, and by a faculty member at UiT. 

For more information (in Norwegian only) about master’s project in collaboration with industry at UiT refer to https://uit.no/enhet/ifi#boks2 where you will also find the standard agreement ([in Norwegian](https://uit.instructure.com/files/1799466/download?download_frd=1) and [in English](https://uit.instructure.com/files/1799467/download?download_frd=1)) that regulates IPR in the project.
